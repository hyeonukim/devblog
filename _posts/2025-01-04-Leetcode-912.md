## Problem
[Leetcode 912 - Sort an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/description/)

Example:
```
Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).

Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]
Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.
```
## Approach

This is just a simple sorting question, but since question states that we solve this problem using $O(n log n)$ time complexity and with the smallest complexity possible, we can use either Quick sort or Merge sort. Since Quick sort could be $O(n^2)$, we will be using Merge Sort to solve this problem. More information on Merge Sort can be found [here](https://hyeonukim.github.io/devblog/posts/Merge-Sort/).


Here is the Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def sortArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        def merge(arr, L, M, R):
            left, right = arr[L : M + 1], arr[M + 1 : R + 1]
            i, j, k = L, 0, 0

            while j < len(left) and k < len(right):
                if left[j] <= right[k]:
                    arr[i] = left[j]
                    j += 1
                else:
                    arr[i] = right[k]
                    k += 1
                i += 1
            while j < len(left):
                nums[i] = left[j]
                j += 1
                i += 1
            while k < len(right):
                nums[i] = right[k]
                k += 1
                i += 1
        
        def mergeSort(arr, l, r):
            if l == r:
                return

            m = (l + r) // 2
            mergeSort(arr, l, m)
            mergeSort(arr, m + 1, r)
            merge(arr, l, m, r)
            return
        
        mergeSort(nums, 0, len(nums))
        return nums

```

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Time Complexity: $O(n log n)$

Space Complexity: $O(n)$
