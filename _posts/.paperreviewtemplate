## Summary of Paper

This paper utilizes LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) for efficient Seq2Seq Machine Translation Architecture
- Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) is bout training models to convert sequences from one language to another langauge
- Before Transformers were introduced used it as state-of-the-art
