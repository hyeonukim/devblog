```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```

## Approach

This problem can be solved by checking whether the left and right subtrees of each node are the same. We can use a recursive function to check whether the left and right subtrees of each node are the same.

Base case:
- If both nodes are null, return True
- If one of the nodes is null, return False
- If the values of the two nodes are different, return False

Recursive case:
- Recursively call the function on the left and right subtrees of the current node

Visualization of the approach:
```
    1       1
   / \     / \
  2   3   2   3

p: 1 == 1, True
p.left: 2 == 2, True
p.right: 3 == 3, True

Thus, the tree is the same, return True.
```

Here is the implementation of the approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        # Base case (1): if both nodes are null, return True
        if not p and not q: return True

        # Base case (2): if one of the nodes is null or the values of the two nodes are different, return False
        if not (p and q and p.val == q.val): return False
        
        # Recursive case: recursively call the function on the left and right subtrees of the current node
        return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
``` 

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is $O(n)$ since we are visiting each node once. 

The space complexity is $O(n)$ since we are using a recursive function.
