## Web Crawler
- Web Crawling is an automated method to retrieve data
- Can get needed information from any service
- Usually used with Python

## Getting HTML code from specific website (1)

```python
import requests

# make a request on specific URL
request = requests.get('https://hyeonukim.github.io/devblog/')

# after connecting, get website's source code
html = request.text.strip()

print(html)
```

## Getting HTML code from specific website (2)

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# make a request on specific URL
request = requests.get('https://hyeonukim.github.io/devblog/')

# after connecting, get website's source code
html = request.text.strip()

# turn HTML source code into python's BeautifulSoup variable
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

# get all the elements consisting of <a> tag
links = soup.select('a')

# for all link 
for link in links:
  # if link has 'href' attribute
  if link.has_attr('href'):
    # href attribute has text 'posts' included
    if link.get('href').find('posts') != -1:
      print(link.text)
```
