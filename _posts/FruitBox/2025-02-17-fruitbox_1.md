## What is Fruit Box Game

I wanted to make a game that follows the general rule of [fruit box game](https://en.gamesaien.com/game/fruit_box/)

It is a simple puzzle game where a player can drag the mouse to exactly enclose some apples so the numbers in the apples total 10.

Player ges 1 point for each apple. As seen in the picture below, that's how players get the points.

## What needs to be implemented

First I divided the game into small tasks that I could start with. 

I am planning to publish the game for mobile, and webGL content.

Task List
- [ ] Main Menu (what players see first)
    - [ ] Button (Play button)
    - [ ] CheckBox (light/dark mode)
    - [ ] Slider (Controlling Audio)

- [ ] Gameplay
    - [ ] User Input (Mouse/Touchpad, something to detect drag motion)
        - [ ] Box should appear to show the user's dragged box and what kind of apples are included
        - [ ] Some mechanic that could detect if sum is 10
        - [ ] Should change color if sum is 10
    - [ ] Board (10 x 17 board? some sort of board)
        - [ ] Apple Object (with signed number 1 to 9)
        - [ ] Reset Button (when player presses resets the board)
        - [ ] Timer Slider (2 minute)
        - [ ] Combo meter
    - [ ] Combo Mechanic
        - [ ] 3 second time window if player gets point within, they get extra point
    - [ ] Score Tracker (high score, score)

- [ ] After Game (Once timer finishes)
    - [ ] Should show your score, and high score
    - [ ] Replay button
    - [ ] Continue button (allows player to continue on the board, score should stop/add don't know yet)
