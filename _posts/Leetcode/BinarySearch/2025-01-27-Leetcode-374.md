## Problem
[Leetcode 374 - Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/description/)

Example:
```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6

Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1

Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

## Approach


Another use case for binary search from number 1 to n where left = 1, and right = n

Here is the Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 1, n
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left+right) // 2

            if guess(mid) == -1:
                right = mid-1
            elif guess(mid) == 1:
                left = mid+1
            else:
                return mid
        
        return -1    
```
## Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Time Complexity: $O(log n)$ 

Space Complexity: $O(1)$
