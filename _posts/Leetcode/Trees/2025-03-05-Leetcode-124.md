## Problem
[Leetcode 124 - Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/)

Example:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```

```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```

## Approach

We can use DFS to solve this problem, with it we can track maxPath, and maxValue. 

maxValue of the root would be root.val + maxPath of left + maxPath of right.

There are some cases that we need to consider for updating path:
- maxPath from left + root.val
- maxPath from right + root.val
- root.val (in case maxPath from left and right are negative, and root.val is non negative)
- 0 (in case maxPath + root.val is negative)

There are some cases that we need to consider for updating maxVal:
- maxPath from left + maxPath from right + root.val
- maxValue from left
- maxValue from right
- root.val (if others are all negative)

We can track of maxPath and maxVal as a base case.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:    
        if not root:
            return [0, float('-inf')]
        
        left = root.left
        right = root.right

        path = max(left[0]+root.val, right[0]+root.val, root.val, 0)
        maxVal = max(left[0]+right[0]+root.val, left[1], right[1], root.val)

        return [path, maxVal]
    return dfs(root)[1]
```
