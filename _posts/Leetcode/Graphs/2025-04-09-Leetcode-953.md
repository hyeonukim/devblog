## Problem
[Leetcode 953 - Verifying an Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/description/)

Example:
```
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.

Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.

Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character
```

## Approach

We can check every word and its adjacent to it if the order index is in the correct way.

if word1[i] != word2[i], then we can compare the order index and if word1[i]'s order index is bigger, then we can return False


Here is the Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def isAlienSorted(self, words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:
        order_index = {c: i for i,c in enumerate(order)}

        for i in range(len(words)-1):
            w1, w2 = words[i], words[i+1]

            for j in range(len(w1)):
                if j == len(w2):
                    return False
                
                if w1[j] != w2[j]:
                    if order_index[w1[j]] > order_index[w2[j]]:
                        return False
                    break
        return True    
```
