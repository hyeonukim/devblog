## Problem
[Leetcode 695 - Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/description/)

Example:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

## Approach


Similar to the Leetcode-200 question, we can use DFS to check valid land.

We can update the res every time we're on valid land during DFS

Here is the Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        res = 0

        def dfs(i, j):
            nonlocal area
            if i < 0 or j < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] == 0:
                return area
            
            print(area)
            grid[i][j] = 0
            area += 1
            dfs(i+1, j)  
            dfs(i-1, j)
            dfs(i, j+1)
            dfs(i, j-1)
            return area

        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == 0:
                    continue
                print(res)
                area = 0
                res = max(res, dfs(i, j))
        
        return res  
```
