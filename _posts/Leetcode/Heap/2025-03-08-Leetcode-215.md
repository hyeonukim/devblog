## Problem
[Leetcode 215 - Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/description/)

Example:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5

Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4
```

## Approach

We can use Heap to pop length of nums - k. Then we will have kth biggest element.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        heapq.heapify(nums)

        for i in range(len(nums)-k):
            heapq.heappop(nums)
        
        return heapq.heappop(nums)    
```
## Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Time Complexity: $O(n log (n-k))$ where $n$ is length of nums

Space Complexity: $O(n)$
