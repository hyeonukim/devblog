## Problem
[Leetcode 1863 - Sum of All Subset XOR Totals](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-all-subset-xor-totals/description/)

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The 4 subsets of [1,3] are:
- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.
- [1] has an XOR total of 1.
- [3] has an XOR total of 3.
- [1,3] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 3 = 2.
0 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 6

Input: nums = [5,1,6]
Output: 28
Explanation: The 8 subsets of [5,1,6] are:
- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.
- [5] has an XOR total of 5.
- [1] has an XOR total of 1.
- [6] has an XOR total of 6.
- [5,1] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 = 4.
- [5,6] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 6 = 3.
- [1,6] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 6 = 7.
- [5,1,6] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 XOR 6 = 2.
0 + 5 + 1 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 28

Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 480
Explanation: The sum of all XOR totals for every subset is 480.
```

## Approach

We can use DFS to get all the subset of the totals

We can either include the element for subset, or not include it

For example with input [5,1,6], we can include 5 or not include 5, then we can branch to include 1 or not include 1, and so forth. then we would have $2^n$ path.

We can then XOR the result.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def subsetXORSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        def dfs(i, total):
            if i == len(nums):
                return total
            
            #total ^ nums[i]  is the case where we include element
            #total is the case where we don't include element
            return dfs(i+1, total ^ nums[i]) + dfs(i+1, total)
    
        return dfs(0, 0)    
```
## Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Time Complexity: $O(2^n)$ 

Space Complexity: $O(n)$
