## Problem
[Leetcode 46 - Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/description/)

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]

Input: nums = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

## Approach

Similar to the question [Leetcode 77 - Combinations](https://hyeonukim.github.io/devblog/posts/Leetcode-77/), we can use the same method, but for every for loop we check if we have appended the element.

This would work since every element in the nums array is distinct. Otherwise, we could have an array to track visited.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []

        def dfs(arr):
            if len(arr) == len(nums):
                res.append(arr.copy())
                return
            
            for i in range(len(nums)):
                if nums[i] in arr:
                    continue
                arr.append(nums[i])
                dfs(arr)
                arr.pop()
        
        dfs([])
        return res
```
## Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Time Complexity: $O(N!)$

Space Complexity: $O(n)$
