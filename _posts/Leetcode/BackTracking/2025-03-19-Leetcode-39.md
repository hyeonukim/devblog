## Problem
[Leetcode 39 - Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/description/)

Example:
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]

Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
Output: []
```

## Approach

We can use DFS to find all the subsets but to optimize better, we can first sort the candidates to take the biggest out of the target.

Visualization of the Approach:
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8

                [5,3,2]
            /           \
        [5]                []
    /     \             /   \
[5,3]     [5]        [3]      []
        /           /  \      / 
    [5,2]       [3,3]  [3]  [2] 
                /      /    / 
            [3,3,2] [3,2] [2,2]
                    /      /
                [3,2,2]  [2,2,2]
                        /
                    [2,2,2,2]

Thus, the only subset array that results total of 8 are [5,3], [3,3,2], [2,2,2,2]
```

Here is the Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        candidates.sort(reverse=True)

        def dfs(i, target, arr):
            if target == 0:
                res.append(arr)
                return
            if i == len(candidates):
                return
            
            if target >= candidates[i]:
                dfs(i, target-candidates[i], arr+[candidates[i]])
            dfs(i+1, target, arr)
        
        dfs(0, target, [])
        return res    
```
