## Problem
[Leetcode 3 - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

Example:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Approach

We can approach this problem by using two pointer and set to keep track of unique characters.

We leave the left pointer on the first element of the string and we can iterate through the character in string (as right pointer).

We can add the s[right] into set
- while s[right] is in set, we can remove s[left] in set then increment left
- otherwise, we can add s[right] in set then update the maxLength

Visualization of the Approach:
```
s = 'abcabcbb'
     l
     r
s_set = (a)
res = 1

s = 'abcabcbb'
     lr
s_set = (a,b)
res = 2

s = 'abcabcbb'
     l r
s_set = (a,b,c)
res = 3

s = 'abcabcbb'
     l  r
Since s[r] is already in set, we increment l and remove s[l]

s = 'abcabcbb'
      l r
s_set = (b,c,a)
res = 3

s = 'abcabcbb'
      l  r
Since s[r] is already in set, we increment l and remove s[l]

s = 'abcabcbb'
       l r
s_set = (c,a,b)
res = 3

s = 'abcabcbb'
       l  r
Since s[r] is already in set, we increment l and remove s[l]

s = 'abcabcbb'
        l r
s_set = (a,b,c)
res = 3

s = 'abcabcbb'
        l  r
Since s[r] is already in set, we increment l and remove s[l]

s = 'abcabcbb'
          lr
s_set = (c,b)
res = 3

s = 'abcabcbb'
          l r
Since s[r] is already in set, we increment l and remove s[l]

s = 'abcabcbb'
            l
            r
s_set = (b)
res = 3

return 3
```

Here is the Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        left = 0
        s_set = set()
        res = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            while s[r] in s_set:
                s_set.remove(s[r])
                left += 1
            s_set.add(s[r])
            res = max(res, r-left+1)
        return res
```
## Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Time Complexity: $O(n)$ where $n$ represents the number of characters in string
 
Space Complexity: $O(m)$ where $m$ represents the number of unique characters in string
