## Problem
[Leetcode 36 - Valid Sudoku](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/)

Example:
```
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true

Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

## Approach

We can solve this problem by having HashSet of each 'row', 'col', and 'sq'

For each HashSet, if board[i][j] exists then we can return False 

If we finish looping through the SudoKu board, then we can return True

Here is the Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        rows = defaultdict(set)
        cols = defaultdict(set)
        sq = defaultdict(set)

        for i in range(9):
            for j in range(9):
                if board[i][j] == '.':
                    continue
                
                if board[i][j] in rows[i] or board[i][j] in cols[j] or board[i][j] in sq[(i//3, j//3)]:
                    return False
                
                rows[i].add(board[i][j])
                cols[j].add(board[i][j])
                sq[(i//3, j//3)].add(board[i][j])
        
        return True
```
