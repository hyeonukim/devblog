## Problem
[Leetcode 25 - Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/)

Example:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```

## Approach

First we get a helper function to get Kth node

Then we reverse the nodes from groupPrev to kNode
- groupPrev: first it's dummy node, then k-1th node
- kNode: to indicate the k'th node if this is None, we should return
- groupNext: k+1'th node
- prev: k+1'th node, use this for reversing the subgroup of nodes
- curr: current node, use this for reversing the subgroup of nodes

Once reversing of subgroup is done, we must connect the groupPrev to subgroup's new head (reversed head)
- temp = groupPrev.next  (should be the new tail)
- groupPrev.next = kNode (should be the new head)
- groupPrev = temp

Visualization of the Approach:
```
head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
groupPrev = dummy
kNode = 2
groupNext = 3
prev, curr = 3, 1

dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
groupPrev = 1
kNode = 4
groupNext = 5
prev, curr = 5, 3

dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5
groupPrev = 3
kNode = None
thus return dummy.next
```

Here is the Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        groupPrev = dummy

        while True:
            kNode = self.getKth(groupPrev, k)
            if not kNode:
                break

            groupNext = kNode.next
            prev, curr = kNode.next, groupPrev.next

            while curr != groupNext:
                temp = curr.next
                curr.next = prev
                prev = curr
                curr = temp

            temp = groupPrev.next
            groupPrev.next = kNode
            groupPrev = temp
            
        return dummy.next

    def getKth(self, curr, k):
        while curr and k > 0:
            curr = curr.next
            k -= 1

        return curr    
```
