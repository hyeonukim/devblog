## Problem
[Leetcode 2 - Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)

Example:
```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

## Approach

We can solve this problem by iterating through l1 and l2 linked list with carry. 

Our new node is going to be the (l1.val + l2.val + carry) % 10, where carry represents the previous nodes' carry-ons.

We repeat this process until l1 and l2 are empty and if there's still carry-on left, we include it to the linked-list.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        carry = 0
        head = ListNode(0)
        curr = head

        while l1 and l2:
            val1 = l1.val
            val2 = l2.val
            
            node = ListNode((val1+val2+carry) % 10)
            carry = (val1+val2+carry) // 10

            curr.next = node
            curr = node
            l1 = l1.next
            l2 = l2.next
        
        while l1:
            val1 = l1.val
            node = ListNode((val1+carry) % 10)
            carry = (val1+carry) // 10
            curr.next = node
            curr = node
            l1 = l1.next
        
        while l2:
            val2 = l2.val
            node = ListNode((val2+carry) % 10)
            carry = (val2+carry) // 10
            curr.next = node
            curr = node
            l2 = l2.next

        if carry:
            curr.next = ListNode(carry)
        
        return head.next
```
