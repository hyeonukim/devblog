## Problem

[Leetcode 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

Example:
```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []

Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

## Approach

We can use a dummy node to start the merged list and a pointer to keep track of the tail of the merged list. Then we can iterate through both lists, compare the values, and append the smaller value to the merged list. We also need to move the pointer of the list that we appended from forward. Once we reach the end of one of the lists, we can append the remaining list to the merged list.

Visual representation of the approach:
```
list1 = 1 -> 2 -> 4
list2 = 1 -> 3 -> 4

dummy = -1 -> None
curr  = -1

since list1.val (1) <= list2.val (1), we append list1 to the merged list.

dummy = -1 -> 1 -> None
curr  = 1

list1 = 2 -> 4
list2 = 1 -> 3 -> 4

since list1.val (2) > list2.val (1), we append list2 to the merged list.

dummy = -1 -> 1 -> 2 -> None
curr  = 1

list1 = 2 -> 4
list2 = 3 -> 4

since list1.val (2) <= list2.val (3), we append list1 to the merged list.

dummy = -1 -> 1 -> 2 -> None
curr  = 2

list1 = 4
list2 = 3 -> 4

since list1.val (4) > list2.val (3), we append list2 to the merged list.

dummy = -1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None
curr  = 3

list1 = 4
list2 = 4

since list1.val (4) <= list2.val (4), we append list1 to the merged list.

dummy = -1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> None
curr  = 4

list1 = None
list2 = 4

Since list1 is now None, we append list2 to the merged list then exit the loop and return dummy.next as it is the head of the merged list.

dummy = -1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> None
```

Here is the implementation of the approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode()
        curr = dummy

        while list1 and list2:
            if list1.val <= list2.val:
                curr.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                curr.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next
            curr = curr.next

        if list1:
            curr.next = list1
        elif list2:
            curr.next = list2

        return dummy.next
```

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity

The time complexity is $ O(n + m) $ where $ n $ is the length of list1 and $ m $ is the length of list2 because we iterate through both lists once.

The space complexity is $ O(1) $ because we are not using any extra space.
