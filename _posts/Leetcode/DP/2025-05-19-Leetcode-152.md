## Problem
[Leetcode 152 - Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/description/)

Example:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.

Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```

## Approach

We can solve this problem using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to keep track of both the prefix and suffix at each position

Here is the Python code for the solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n, res = len(nums), nums[0]
        prefix = suffix = 0

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            prefix = nums[i] * (prefix or 1)
            suffix = nums[n-1-i] * (suffix or 1)
            res = max(res, max(prefix, suffix))
        
        return res
```

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Time Complexity: $O(n)$  

Space Complexity: $O(1)$
