I'm glad you're here! This blog is where I share my passion for **game development**, **algorithm analysis**, **computer vision**, and other things.

I graduated from **Simon Fraser University** with a degree in **Computer Science**. Here's a quick look at my recent work experience:

-  **_Research Assistant_** at SFU  
**July 2022 – April 2023**  
  Worked on **GAN models** and **Dynamic Time Warping** to generate missing data for **Electric Vehicle charging stations**.

- **_Software Developer_** at Hammer & Tong  
**April 2023 – August 2023**  
  Developed a **narrative Unity game**, mentored artists on using **Git**, and handled **technical writing**.
